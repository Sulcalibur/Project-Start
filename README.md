Project-Start
=============

Project start up files for Development for web site work using Compass, Sass, Codekit and .kit files.

This is just a simple way for me to hit the ground running on my web design projects. This is a personal starter for me but by all means if you want to fork it or have any ideas on how to make it better, by all means knock yourselfs out :)

All the best
